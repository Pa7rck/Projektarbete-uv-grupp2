LOST AND CONFUSED

You wake up in the woods, disoriented. You don't know where you are or how you got there.
It's gloomy and the fog is covering parts of the forest.
You're starting to feel anxious and realize that it's probably best not to linger.

There's a path to the left, although, the fog makes it difficult to determine what lies ahead.
To the right, in the distance, you distinguish what you believe to be a road.
However, in this path you'd have to cross a swamp like area, and its potential dangers.
